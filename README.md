Netflix Search Suggestion 
In this project, I developed a submodule that enhances the search mechanism of Netflix. The key functionality of this feature is that it provides real-time suggestions as the user begins typing, starting from the first letter. The system automatically displays relevant suggestions based on the input, improving the user experience by allowing quicker and more accurate searches.

Key Features:
Real-time Suggestions: As the user types, relevant content suggestions appear instantly.
Efficient Query Processing: The system processes user input dynamically to display accurate results.
Improved User Experience: By providing suggestions early, it helps users find content faster and with fewer keystrokes.
